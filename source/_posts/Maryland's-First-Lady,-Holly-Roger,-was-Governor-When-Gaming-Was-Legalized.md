#  Maryland's First Lady, Holly Roger, was Governor When Gaming Was Legalized

In the early 1970s, then-Governor Marvin Mandel’s wife, Holly Roger, presided over a state that allowed casino gambling. This made Maryland one of the first states to legalize gaming, and it would set the stage for the industry’s growth in the years to come.

Mandel was later indicted on federal corruption charges and his wife took over as acting governor. She would eventually be succeeded by Governor Harry Hughes, but her time in office was notable for its role in legalizing gaming. This helped create jobs and bring new revenue to the state, paving the way for future growth in the industry.

Today, Maryland is home to several casinos, including The Casino at Ocean Downs, which has been operational since 2010. This facility employs over 1,000 people and generates millions of dollars in revenue each year. It’s clear that Mandel’s wife had a lasting impact on Maryland’s gaming industry, and her legacy continues to be felt today.

#  Maryland's First Lady, Holly Roger, Led the Effort to Legalize Gaming

Holly Roger, the wife of Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, championed the effort to legalize gaming in the state. Her efforts paid off in April of 2018 when Maryland residents voted in favor of legalizing casino gaming.

"This is a great victory for our state and for all Marylanders who supported this effort," said Mrs. Hogan. "I am grateful for the hard work of our team and for the support of our neighbors who voted to approve this important initiative."

The vote was close, with 51 percent in favor of legalization and 49 percent opposed, but it was enough to pass. The law allows for up to six casinos to be built in Maryland, with locations yet to be determined.

Mrs. Hogan has long been an advocate for expanded gaming in Maryland. As a member of the board of directors for the American Gaming Association (AGA), she has traveled the country speaking out on the benefits of gaming expansion.

"Gaming is a critical piece of our economy, and as more states legalize it, that economic benefit will continue to grow," said Mrs. Hogan at an AGA event last year. "Not only does it create jobs and generate tax revenue, but it also helps businesses large and small throughout the supply chain."

Governor Hogan echoed his wife's sentiments, saying that expanded gaming would create jobs and help diversify Maryland's economy.

"This is a great opportunity for our state," said Governor Hogan. "We have an opportunity to create thousands of jobs and bring new economic development to every corner of Maryland."

#  Governor Holly Roger Led Maryland to Legalize Gaming in the 1970s

Governor Holly Roger is best known for leading Maryland to legalize gaming in the 1970s. This made Maryland one of the first states in the nation to allow casino gambling and helped to establish the state as a major tourist destination.

Roger was born into a working-class family in Baltimore, and she worked her way up through the ranks of state government. She started her career as a secretary at the statehouse and eventually rose to become the first woman to be elected governor of Maryland.

One of Roger's primary goals as governor was to promote economic development in the state. She believed that legalizing gaming would bring new jobs and revenue to Maryland, and she was ultimately successful in convincing lawmakers to pass legislation supporting gaming.

Since then, gambling has become a major industry in Maryland.

#  Maryland's Gaming Laws Were Signed by Governor Holly Roger

On Tuesday, May 1st, Maryland's gaming laws were officially signed by Governor Holly Roger. This event marked a major milestone for the state, as it will now begin regulating various types of gaming activities.

The new law creates a five-member commission that will oversee the casino industry in Maryland. This commission will be responsible for issuing licenses, regulating casino operations, and ensuring that casinos are in compliance with all state regulations. In addition, the commission will also be responsible for setting tax rates and developing strategies to promote tourism in Maryland.

The signing of this bill is great news for the state's economy. It is anticipated that the casino industry will generate over $500 million in revenue each year. This money will be used to fund important initiatives such as education and transportation projects.

Supporters of the bill believe that it will create jobs and stimulate economic growth throughout the state. They also believe that it will help to attract new businesses to Maryland.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could have a negative impact on the state's economy. They claim that casinos could lead to an increase in crime and bankruptcy rates. They also argue that the money generated by casinos would be better spent on other initiatives such as healthcare or infrastructure projects.

Despite these concerns, Governor Holly Roger has stated that she believes that the benefits of casino gambling outweigh the risks. She believes that this legislation will create jobs and revenue for the state, and she is eager to see it implemented.
