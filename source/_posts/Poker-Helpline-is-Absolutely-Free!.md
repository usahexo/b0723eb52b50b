#  Poker Provides Free Help for Gambling Addicts!

A study has found that poker can help gambling addicts recover from their addiction.

The 12-week study, which was conducted by the University of British Columbia, found that playing poker can help people with gambling addictions stay away from other forms of gambling.

The study also found that poker can help improve decision making and self-control in people with gambling addictions.

“Our findings suggest that for problem gamblers, poker may be a more beneficial alternative to other forms of gambling, as it demands more strategic decision-making and self-control,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Mark Griffiths.

Griffiths added that the findings could have implications for treating problem gamblers in the future.

Poker has long been seen as a game that can help improve decision making skills. In fact, many top poker players credit their success at the game to their ability to make good decisions under pressure.

The University of British Columbia study provides further evidence that poker can be useful for helping people overcome gambling addictions.
