#  Nevada to offer legal betting on sports at Tiger Bay Casino!

Nevada is all set to offer legal betting on sports at Tiger Bay Casino. The regulations for such gambling were approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in a meeting that was held last week. This would allow casino-goers in the state to place bets on sporting events as well as horse races at the facility.

The board has given its nod to a proposal that would see a percentage of each wager placed going towards funding state education programs. Furthermore, those making wagers would also be subject to paying taxes on their winnings.

This move is seen as a positive development for the casino, which has been struggling in recent years. The addition of sports betting is expected to bring in new customers and revive interest in the venue.

Tiger Bay Casino is one of several properties in Nevada that will offer legalized sports betting. Gaming regulators have been working on regulations for this activity since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last year.
