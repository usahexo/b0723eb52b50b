# Learn How To Properly Play Blackjack and Conquer the Casino! 

In the game of blackjack, players attempt to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The Ace is worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10, and other cards are worth their number value.

To begin the game, each player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down. Players must decide whether to hit (take another card), stand (stick with what they have), double down (double their bet and receive one more card), split (split two identical cards into two separate hands) or surrender (give up the hand and lose half the bet).

After all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals his facedown card. If it is an Ace, players can choose to take insurance against the dealer having a blackjack (a natural 21). If the dealer has a blackjack, players who took insurance lose their bets but those who did not lose automatically. If the dealer’s card is not an Ace, play proceeds as normal.

The winning hand in blackjack is equivalent to a 6-card poker hand. For example, if your first two cards are an Ace and a 3, that would be considered a “poker” hand of Ace-3-4-5-6-7. The best possible poker hand is ace high – A-K-Q-J-10 – which would beat any other combination of six cards. In fact, there are only four possible ways to make a poker hand out of your first six cards: 6-5-4-3-2; 6-4-3-2-1; 5-4-3-2-1; or 4-3-2-1-0.

If both you and the dealer have identical hands (e.g., two Jacks), it is called a “push” and no money changes hands. In some casinos, pushes are considered ties and the player typically gets their original wager back minus a tiny commission known as “the house edge”.
