# My Summer Car: How to Steal Slot Machine

My Summer Car is a popular Finnish simulation game that allows players to experience living in a small Finnish town and building a car from scratch. One of the many activities players can do in the game is visit the local pub, where they can play the slot machine. However, some players have wondered if it is possible to steal the slot machine from the pub. In this article, we will discuss how to steal the slot machine in My Summer Car.

## Step 1: Obtain the tools

To steal the slot machine, you will need some tools. These tools include the crowbar, which can be found in the garage, and the hammer, which can be found in the house. You will also need the van to transport the slot machine once you have stolen it.

## Step 2: Enter the pub

The pub is located in the town center, and it is open from 12 PM to 2 AM. You can enter the pub by walking through the front door. Once inside, you will see the slot machine in the corner of the room.

## Step 3: Wait for the right moment

The pub owner is always watching the customers, so you will need to be patient and wait for the right moment to steal the slot machine. The best time to steal the slot machine is when the owner is not looking. You can distract the owner by buying a beer or by playing the slot machine.

## Step 4: Steal the slot machine

Once you have distracted the owner, use the crowbar to pry the slot machine off its stand. Be careful not to make too much noise, as this will alert the owner. Once the slot machine is off the stand, use the hammer to break the lock on the cash box. Take all the money from the cash box and put it in your pocket.

## Step 5: Escape with the slot machine

After you have stolen the money, you will need to transport the slot machine out of the pub. This is where the van comes in handy. Push the slot machine out of the pub and load it into the van. Drive the van back to your house and unload the slot machine.

## Conclusion

Stealing the slot machine in My Summer Car is not an easy task, but it is possible. You will need to be patient and wait for the right moment to strike. Remember to bring the necessary tools, such as the crowbar and hammer, and be prepared to transport the slot machine once you have stolen it. Happy stealing!
