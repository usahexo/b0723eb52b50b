#  Yankees and Red Sox Lead Way in American League East
Counting down the days until baseball season starts, there are a few things that are for sure. One, the Yankees and Red Sox will be in the top of the American League East. Two, the National League West will be a close race with the Dodgers and Rockies fighting for first. And three, Shohei Ohtani will be one to watch.

The Yankees offseason has been interesting to say the least. After re-signing CC Sabathia and Chase Headley, they traded for Giancarlo Stanton from the Marlins. Adding Stanton to an already powerful lineup makes them even scarier. The Red Sox have been busy as well, signing J.D Martinez and trading for Chris Sale last season. These two teams are clearly head and shoulders above the rest of the AL East.

The National League West is looking to be a tight race this year as well. The Dodgers were dominant last season, but they lost Yu Darvish in free agency and Clayton Kershaw has been dealing with injuries lately. The Rockies made some big moves this offseason, signing Ian Desmond and Wade Davis. They look poised to take over first place from the Dodgers this year.

Finally, Shohei Ohtani is a player to watch this season. He signed with the Angels this offseason and is expected to be a part of their starting rotation. He was impressive in Japan last season, so it will be interesting to see how he does in MLB this year.

#  Blue Jays, Orioles Look to Catch A Break in AL East

The AL East is shaping up to be a three-team race this season, with the Yankees, Red Sox, and Rays all off to strong starts. The Blue Jays and Orioles are looking to catch a break and make it a four-team race.

The Blue Jays got off to a hot start, but have since cooled off. They sit in fourth place, five games back of the Yankees. The Orioles are in last place, but only six games back of the Yankees.

The Blue Jays have been hurt by injuries this season. All-Star third baseman Josh Donaldson has missed time with a calf injury, and shortstop Troy Tulowitzki has been out with a hamstring injury. The Blue Jays are hoping that both players will be able to return soon.

The Orioles have also been hit by injuries. Outfielder Adam Jones has missed time with a hip injury, and starting pitcher Dylan Bundy has been out with an elbow injury. The Orioles are hoping that both players will be able to return soon.

The Blue Jays and Orioles both have talented rosters and should be able to catch up to the Yankees and Rays if they can stay healthy.

#  Yankees and Red Sox Vie for Dominance in AL East

The rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox is one of the most storied in all of sports. The two teams have been competing against each other for over a century, and their games are always hotly contested.

This season, the Yankees and Red Sox are once again neck-and-neck in the American League East. Both teams are off to strong starts, and it looks like they will be battling it out all season long.

The Yankees got off to a fast start, thanks in part to the exploits of young sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton. But the Red Sox have been hot as well, thanks to the emergence of rookie phenom Mookie Betts.

So far this season, both teams have shown that they are capable of winning ballgames. The Yankees have a powerful lineup and a lights-out bullpen, while the Red Sox have enough firepower to compete with anyone.

It should be an interesting battle between these two rivals, and there is sure to be plenty of drama along the way. Who will come out on top in the AL East? Only time will tell.

#  Could the Baltimore Orioles Surprise Everyone in the American League East?

The Baltimore Orioles had a relatively quiet offseason after finishing first in the American League East in 2014. The only significant move was the signing of outfielder Dexter Fowler to a three-year, $35 million contract.

The Orioles have an intriguing mix of young players and veterans. Machado, Jones, and Wieters are all entering their fourth full seasons in the league. All three are All-Stars and each of them batted over .280 last season. J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis, and Darren O'Day provide veteran leadership and stability on defense. Wei-Yin Chen, Bud Norris, and Kevin Gausman are all young pitchers who could make an impact this season.

There are some questions about the bullpen and the rotation beyond Chen and Norris. Zach Britton, Ubaldo Jimenez, and Tommy Hunter are all capable relievers, but none of them is a lockdown closer. Wei-Yin Chen had a breakout season in 2014, but Bud Norris has been inconsistent throughout his career. Kevin Gausman has tremendous potential, but he is still unproven at the major league level.

The American League East is always tough with the Yankees, Red Sox, Rays, and Blue Jays all expected to contend. However, the Orioles have as good a chance as anyone to win the division this season.

#  Toronto Blue Jays Eyeing a Repeat Performance in the American League East

The Toronto Blue Jays surprised many last season by winning the American League East division, their first divisional championship in over two decades. The team is looking to repeat that performance this year and make a deep playoff run.

Much of the Blue Jays' success last season was due to their strong pitching staff. Led by Cy Young Award-winning pitcher David Price, the rotation was one of the best in baseball. This year, the team will need to rely on their pitching once again if they hope to repeat as division champions.

Offensively, the Blue Jays are led by All-Star Josh Donaldson. The third baseman batted .297 with 41 home runs and 123 RBIs last season and will be looking to build on that performance in 2016. Other key contributors offensively include Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion, and Troy Tulowitzki.

The Blue Jays enter the 2016 season as one of the favourites to win the World Series. With a talented roster and a manager in John Gibbons who knows how to win in October, there's no reason why they can't make a run at it.
