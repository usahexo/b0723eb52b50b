            <h1 id="Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-Exceeds-Expectations"><a href="#Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-Exceeds-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Casino Tax Revenue Exceeds Expectations"></a>Maryland Casino Tax Revenue Exceeds Expectations</h1><p>The Maryland casino tax revenue has exceeded expectations by a wide margin, according to state officials. The $52 million generated in taxes during the first six months of legalized gambling is more than twice the original estimate of $24 million.</p>
<p>Most of the tax revenue comes from the four casinos located in Baltimore, including the recently opened Horseshoe Casino. Additional taxes are collected from slot machines at racetracks and selected other locations around the state.</p>
<p>Some of the money is earmarked for education, with the remainder being used to support programs related to problem gambling and other social issues. In addition, a portion of the casino tax revenue is sent to the State’s General Fund to help pay for government operations.</p>
<p>Gambling opponents had predicted that legalized casino gambling would result in less state revenue because residents would spend their money at the casinos rather than paying taxes. But that doesn’t appear to be the case, at least so far.</p>
<p>The increase in tax revenue is being attributed largely to increased visitation at the casinos, as well as higher average spending by players. Maryland now has one of the highest tax rates on casino gambling in the country.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-at-158-million-in-first-year"><a href="#Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-at-158-million-in-first-year" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Casino Tax Revenue at $158 million in first year"></a>Maryland Casino Tax Revenue at $158 million in first year</h1><p>Maryland’s casino tax revenue hit $158 million in the first year of operations, exceeding expectations. The state had projected that it would take in $125 million in taxes from its six casinos in the first full year of operation.</p>
<p>Revenue from casino taxes is expected to increase as more casinos come online. MGM National Harbor, which opened at the end of 2016, generated $45 million in taxes in its first year of operation. That number is expected to more than double once Live! Casino &amp; Hotel, which is owned by The Cordish Companies, comes online this summer.</p>
<p>The extra tax revenue is a welcome windfall for the state, which is facing a fiscal crisis. Maryland ranks 49th in the country when it comes to per-capita revenue from gambling, generating just $52 per person. That number is expected to increase as casino tax revenue continues to grow.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Requires-Casinos-to-Report-All-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Maryland-Requires-Casinos-to-Report-All-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Requires Casinos to Report All Gambling Winnings"></a>Maryland Requires Casinos to Report All Gambling Winnings</h1><p>Maryland has become the latest state to require casinos to report all gambling winnings. The new law took effect on October 1, and it requires casinos to report all of their gambling winnings, regardless of the amount. This means that even small winnings must be reported.</p>
<p>Governor Larry Hogan signed the bill into law in May, and it was designed to help the state collect more information about gambling activity. The new law will help Maryland track down tax evaders and other criminals who are involved in gambling. It will also help the state better understand the extent of gambling in Maryland.</p>
<p>Casinos will be required to report all of their gambling winnings, including cash and prizes won from slot machines, table games, and poker tournaments. They will also be required to report any commissions or bonuses they receive from their affiliates. This information will be reported to the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Commission, which will then compile a database of all gambling winnings in the state.</p>
<p>The new law is similar to a law that was recently passed in New Jersey. That law requires casinos in Atlantic City to report all of their gambling winnings, regardless of the amount.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-Tops-1-Billion"><a href="#Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-Tops-1-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Casino Tax Revenue Tops $1 Billion"></a>Maryland Casino Tax Revenue Tops $1 Billion</h1><p>The Maryland casino tax revenue has topped $1 billion as of March 2019, according to a report from the state’s gaming control board. The total amount of revenue generated by the state’s six casinos amounted to $1.01 billion from July 2018 through March 2019.</p>
<p>The numbers underscore the growing importance of casinos as a source of government revenue. Casinos have become an increasingly important part of the economy in states where they are legal, with tax revenue from gambling often helping to close budget gaps or fund important programs.</p>
<p>In Maryland, much of the casino tax revenue is funneled into education funding. In fiscal year 2018, which ended in June, $239 million in casino tax revenue was dedicated to education funding. That was about 24 percent of the total education funding for the year.</p>
<p>Maryland has seen a big boost in casino tax revenue in recent years. In fiscal year 2017, which ran from July 2016 to June 2017, the state collected just over $786 million in casino tax revenue. The increase is due in part to new casinos that have opened in recent years, including MGM National Harbor near Washington D.C. and Live! Casino and Hotel near Baltimore.</p>
<p>Maryland isn’t the only state where casinos are providing a significant boost to government coffers. In Pennsylvania, which has 12 casinos, gambling taxes brought in over $2 billion in fiscal year 2018. That accounted for about 14 percent of all state revenue during the period.</p>
<p>Casinos have also become an important source of jobs and economic development in many states where they are legal. In Maryland, for example, MGM National Harbor employs over 5,000 people and has been a major driver of job growth in Prince George’s County since it opened in late 2016.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-Grows-to-1-5-Billion"><a href="#Maryland-Casino-Tax-Revenue-Grows-to-1-5-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Casino Tax Revenue Grows to $1.5 Billion"></a>Maryland Casino Tax Revenue Grows to $1.5 Billion</h1><p>Maryland’s casino industry is booming and shows no signs of slowing down, with tax revenue reaching a new high of $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2019. This is an increase of over $200 million from the previous year and more than double the amount generated in fiscal year 2017.</p>
<p>The numbers are impressive, but they don’t tell the whole story. The money generated by Maryland’s casinos goes toward vital programs and services, including education, health care, and public safety. In fact, casino tax revenue now accounts for over 10 percent of the state’s total budget.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Maryland residents? It means that our schools are getting more funding, our hospitals are getting healthier, and our streets are becoming safer. And it all started with a decision to legalize gambling in our state.</p>
<p>So what’s behind this continued success? There are a few factors at work here. First, Maryland has a healthy mix of casinos – you can find everything from small tribal casinos to large resort properties. This gives players plenty of options and keeps the market competitive.</p>
<p>Second, Maryland has invested heavily in marketing its casinos both domestically and internationally. The state’s Gaming Board has worked hard to create a positive image for Maryland gaming and to attract new players to our casinos.</p>
<p>And finally, Maryland has made it a priority to ensure that its casinos are safe and secure. This includes rigorous licensing and regulation standards as well as ongoing monitoring and enforcement activities. Players can feel confident that their money is being handled responsibly and that they’re getting a fair game when they visit a Maryland casino.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t been to a casino in Maryland lately, now is the time to check them out! You may be surprised at just how much fun you can have – and how much money you can win.</p>
