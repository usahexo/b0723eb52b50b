            <h1 id="How-Many-Hands-and-Fingers-is-Poker"><a href="#How-Many-Hands-and-Fingers-is-Poker" class="headerlink" title="How Many Hands and Fingers is Poker?"></a>How Many Hands and Fingers is Poker?</h1><p>There is so much speculation on how many hands and fingers poker has.<br>Some say it has 10 fingers, others say it has 9. But what is the true answer?</p>
<p>Well, first let’s take a look at what the traditional deck of cards consists of: 52 cards in 4 suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades). That’s 13 cards per suit, and since there are 4 suits there are 52 cards in total. So with that knowledge we can deduct that poker does have 10 fingers because if it had 9 fingers then it would only have 48 cards in a deck (not counting Jokers). </p>
<p>Now when playing poker there are 5 players at a table (or 6 players if playing Cut-throat Poker), so each player would have 2 cards in their hand. That means there are 10 hands in total at a table. And as for fingers…well, that’s up for interpretation!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Poker-with-8-Hands"><a href="#How-to-Play-Poker-with-8-Hands" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Poker with 8 Hands"></a>How to Play Poker with 8 Hands</h1><p>Are you looking to add an extra layer of excitement to your poker game? Why not consider playing with 8 hands instead of the traditional 2 or 4? This can be a fun way to up the ante and keep your opponents on their toes. Here’s a quick guide on how to play poker with 8 hands.</p>
<p>To start, each player is dealt eight cards, face down. The aim of the game is to create the best possible five-card poker hand using any two of your eight cards and the five community cards. There are a few things to keep in mind when playing with 8 hands:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can use any two of your eight cards to make your hand. This includes both your hole cards and the community cards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to win, your final five-card hand must rank higher than all of your opponent’s hands (assuming they have more than one).</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are still only allowed to use one card from each hand when making your final five-card hand. For example, if you have two aces in one hand and two kings in another, you can only use one ace and one king when making your final hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can still use traditional poker strategy when playing with 8 hands. For example, you may want to fold weaker hands in order to conserve chips, or raise more with stronger hands in order to build up a pot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The game progresses as normal once all eight cards have been played. This means that players can still fold, call, raise or bet as they see fit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the end of the hand, the player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot. If there is a tie, then the pot is divided equally amongst those players involved in the tie.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Playing-Poker-with-4-Hands"><a href="#Playing-Poker-with-4-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Playing Poker with 4 Hands"></a>Playing Poker with 4 Hands</h1><p>In poker, there are a variety of different games that can be played. While some people may only be familiar with Texas Hold ‘Em, there are other variants such as Omaha, Razz and 7-card stud. In this article, we will focus on the latter game – 7-card stud.</p>
<p>7-card stud is a game where players are dealt seven cards, two of which are face down and the rest face up. The players then take turns betting and the showdown occurs when the last bet has been made. The player with the best five-card hand (based on traditional poker ranking) wins the pot.</p>
<p>The following is a list of tips for playing 7-card stud: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Familiarize yourself with the basic ranking of hands. In 7-card stud, the hands rank from ace high to 2 low (a full house is 3s over 2s). There are a number of online resources which can provide you with a comprehensive list of rankings. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Pay attention to your position at the table. Your position relative to the dealer will dictate how much information you have about your opponents’ hands, as well as how much they can learn about yours. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of your opponents’ betting patterns. This will give you an idea of what type of hands they may be holding. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Be cautious when bluffing. Bluffing is risky in 7-card stud as it can easily be called by an opponent who has a better hand than you. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your position to your advantage. If you have a strong hand, try to slow down the action by not betting too aggressively. Conversely, if you have a weak hand, bet aggressively in order to get more money into the pot. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to make sure that you have enough money in front of you to see all the way to the showdown (known as having “pot equity”). This will help reduce your chances of being forced out of a pot before you have had a chance to reveal your cards. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7-card stud can be a challenging but fun game to play. By following these tips, you should be able to improve your chances of winning pots and enjoying this classic poker variant!</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Tips-Playing-with-10-Hands"><a href="#Poker-Tips-Playing-with-10-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Poker Tips - Playing with 10 Hands"></a>Poker Tips - Playing with 10 Hands</h1><p>A poker game is usually played with 10 hands. The basic idea behind playing 10 hands at once is that players can use more than one hand to play different betting patterns and disguise the strength of their hand.</p>
<p>It’s also a way to make decisions faster, since you only have to think about 10 hands instead of all 52 cards in the deck. It can be a little confusing at first, but after you get used to it, you’ll be able to play much faster and make better decisions.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember when playing with 10 hands is that you need to keep track of what’s going on in every hand. You can’t afford to lose focus, especially in later rounds when the pots are getting bigger.</p>

This is a less risky strategy than bluffing, but it can also be less profitable.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to both strategies, so you need to decide which one works best for your particular game. Just remember that neither strategy works if your opponents can see through your façade and call your bets!</p>
